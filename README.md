# Blackjack Card Game in Java
Welcome to the Blackjack Card Game in the Java repository! This project implements the classic Blackjack (also known as 21) card game in the Java programming language. It provides a graphical interface for users to play the game against the computer dealer (AI).

# Rules of game
+ The goal of the game is to have a hand value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it.
+ Each player is dealt two cards initially.
+ Numbered cards (2 to 10) are worth their face value, face cards (Jacks, Queens, and Kings) are worth 10, and Aces is worth 1.
+ You can choose to "hit" to receive an additional card or "stand" to keep your current hand value.
+ If your hand value exceeds 21, you bust and lose the game. If the dealer busts or has a lower hand value than you, you win the game.
+ If you and the dealer both have hands with values less than or equal to 21, the one closest to 21 without exceeding it wins the game.
